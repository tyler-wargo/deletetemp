# deletetemp
a Python program that attempts to move the files within the "temp" and "%temp%" folders to the recycle bin on a windows machine 

I created this Python program with the intention of moving the files from the temporary folders to the recycle bin "with one click". 

If you run this code and there are errors or you run into issues with deleting incorrect files keep in mind that this is a beta program that is still in the process of creation.
